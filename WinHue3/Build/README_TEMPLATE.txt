/// WinHue 3 - {release}
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 

NOTE : You need Microsoft Dot Net Framework 4.5.2 for this program to work properly. 
You might also need Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable library. 
Both are available at Microsoft's website. 

WARNING : From this version V1 of the bridge is not supported and will be blocked in WinHue. There is no option to bypass this and will not be any.
If you are affected the only solution is to either use an older version without any support (Wont fix bugs) or buy a new one. Those are pretty cheap when bought alone.

NOTE : Since I'm in the process of upgrading WinHue to .Net Core, I will not add any new feature to WinHue for the moment being.

Fixed:
- Fixed blank screen on first pairing (saving bug)
- Fixed missing elements in the treeview when creating rules.
- Fixed a bug where searching for an new sensor and refreshing before the end of the minute would add a duplicate to the main window.
- Fixed reverse button 3 and 4 in the hue tap creator.
- Possible crash when editing the bridge file and changing ip to a hostname
- Missing unreachable status in the main windows. Unreachable lights will now appear with a blacking background.

Added:
- 

Changed:
- 

Updated :
- 

Removed :
- Compatibility with V1 Bridge. As of now those bridges will not be compatible with WinHue and will not be working. Those devices are going EOL and will not be supported by philips anymore.
if you want to continue using WinHue please get a V2. Those bridges are cheap when bought alone without any bulb and will get you more recent apiversion as well as new functionnalities.

WIP:
- Animation creator. (Not Available yet)
- Cannot clone entertainement at the moment.
