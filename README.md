***PHILIPS HUE HAS RELEASED BLUETOOTH ENABLES HUE BULBS. WINHUE DOES NOT SUPPORT THAT NEW AND SEVERELY LIMITED MODE OF COMMUNICATION FOUND IN THOSE NEW HUE LIGHTS BULBS. HOWEVER, THOSE LIGHT BULBS ARE STILL HUE LIGHT BULBS AND WILL WORK JUST FINE WITH WINHUE, EXACTLY LIKE THE PREVIOUS NONE BLUETOOTH ENABLE HUE LIGHT BULBS. THE USE OF A BRIDGE IS MANDATORY AS IT IS THE COMPUTER THAT CONTROLS THE ENTIRE SYSTEM PERMITTING AUTOMATION. IT'S ALSO THE INTERFACE TO YOUR HOME ETHERNET AND Wi-Fi USED BY WINHUE, AND IT WILL PERMIT A FAR GREATER RANGE OF COVERAGE COMPARED TO BLUETOOTH. THE BRIDGE RANGE WILL USUALLY COVER AN ENTIRE REGULAR SIZE HOUSE IF NOT WAY MORE AS EACH ADDED LIGHT ACT LIKE A SIGNAL REPEATER EXTENDING THE RANGE EVEN FURTHER. AS FOR BLUETOOTH, IT IS QUITE SEVERELY RESTRICTED IN RANGE, TO ABOUT 15 FEET (ONE ROOM), AND IT WILL LIMIT YOUR CONTROL TO 10 LIGHT OR LESS. FINALLY, BLUETOOTH DOES NOT SUPPORT THE USE OF TIMERS.

<b> FAQ : </b>
- Does WinHue work with x system ?
    Answer : No WinHue is made to be used with the philips hue system and api and won't work with other systems.
- Does WinHue work with alexa ?
    Answer : If you have alexa and philips hue bulbs without any bridge WinHue won't work. WinHue will only work with a bridge and     philips hue bulbs.
- Can you make WinHue work with x system :
    Answer : My goal was and still is to have a Windows application be able to control the philips hue lighting system. In other words no but feel free to fork my project and try to adapt it yourself. The Hue API is too deeply embedded inside WinHue that it will most likely need a complete rework of the code to be able to make it work with other system.
